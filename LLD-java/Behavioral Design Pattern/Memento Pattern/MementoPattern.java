// Memento Pattern 

/*
Introduction
Behavioral design patterns deal with the communication and responsibility between objects, helping to design more flexible and robust systems. One such pattern is the Memento Pattern, which provides a way to capture and restore an object's state without violating encapsulation. This is particularly useful in applications where undo or rollback functionality is required.

Imagine you're working in a document editing application. As you make changes to the text, you'd like the ability to undo your edits and revert to a previous version. Instead of exposing the internal structure of the document object, the system uses a memento to store its state at a given point in time. These mementos can later be used to restore the document to that state, all while keeping the implementation details hidden from the outside world.

In the following sections, we’ll dive deeper into the Memento Pattern, understanding how it allows us to preserve snapshots of an object’s state and restore them as needed, without breaching the principle of encapsulation.

Memento Pattern

Formal Definition
The Memento Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to capture its internal state and restore it later without violating encapsulation. It is especially useful when implementing features like undo/redo or rollback.
Key Components
This pattern defines three key components:
Originator: The object whose internal state we want to save and restore.
Memento: A storage object that holds the snapshot of the originator’s state.
Caretaker: The object responsible for requesting the memento and keeping track of it. It neither modifies nor examines the contents of the memento.
Real-Life Analogy: Undo/Redo in Text Editors
Think of the Memento Pattern as an undo/redo mechanism. When you type or edit something in a text editor, the application captures snapshots of the document at different points. Each snapshot (memento) is stored by an external caretaker (like a history stack), and the editor (originator) can revert to these snapshots when needed, without exposing its internal logic.

A key strength of the pattern is that the originator alone is responsible for creating its snapshots, thus preserving encapsulation while still allowing state recovery.

Let's now understand the working of the Memento Pattern through the help of a problem statement.
Understanding the Problem
Assume we are building a resume editor where a user can make changes to their resume - such as name, education, experience, or skills, and may also want the ability to undo or redo changes. To do this, we need a way to take a snapshot of the resume at any point in time and restore it later.

===================================================================================================================
Implementing the Memento Pattern
The Solution
The issues in the previous implementation can be effectively solved using the Memento Pattern. This pattern enables the originator (the object whose state we want to save) to produce a memento (a snapshot of its internal state), which can then be managed by a caretaker. The key advantage is that the object’s internal state is restored without breaking encapsulation, and we can maintain a history of changes.

The Memento Pattern introduces three components:

Originator: The object whose state we want to capture and restore. (In this case: ResumeEditor)
Memento: An immutable object that stores the internal state of the originator.
Caretaker: The object that holds and manages multiple mementos, enabling undo operations. (In this case: ResumeHistory)

===================================================================================================================

Let's now understand how the Memento pattern solves the previously discussed issues.
How Memento Pattern Solves The Issues

Issues	                                How Memento Pattern Fixes It
No Caretaker	                        ResumeHistory class manages all snapshots (mementos) and performs undo operations.
Only one level of undo	                Stack<ResumeEditor.Memento> maintains history of states, enabling multiple undo levels.
Public fields in snapshot	            Memento fields are private final, ensuring proper encapsulation.
Tight coupling with ResumeEditor	    Memento acts as a data capsule, hiding internal structure of ResumeEditor.
Snapshot logic spread outside class	    Snapshot creation/restoration is internal to ResumeEditor, improving cohesion.

Additionally, the Memento Pattern delegates the responsibility of creating state snapshots to the actual owner of the state, i.e., the originator itself. Since the originator has full access to its internal state, it is the most suitable component to generate accurate and complete mementos. This maintains encapsulation while still enabling full rollback capabilities.
When to Use Memento Pattern
The Memento Pattern is most useful in scenarios where an object’s state needs to be saved and restored at various points in time, without exposing its internal structure. Consider using the Memento Pattern in the following situations:

You need to implement undo/redo functionality:
The Memento Pattern allows you to store and restore previous states, enabling seamless undo/redo operations.
You want to preserve the encapsulation of the object's state:
The pattern lets you save an object's internal state without exposing its private fields to the outside world.
You are handling non-trivial state history management:
For scenarios requiring multiple checkpoints or rollbacks, mementos offer a structured and maintainable solution.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Memento Pattern

================================================================================================================

Pros
Preserves encapsulation
The originator can save and restore its own state without exposing its internal structure.
Simplifies undo/redo functionality
By maintaining snapshots of state, the pattern provides a clean way to implement undo/redo features.
Cleaner separation of concerns
The originator handles state, while the caretaker manages history—leading to modular and maintainable code.

Cons
Can be memory-intensive if storing too many states
Saving large or frequent snapshots can consume significant memory.
Might introduce caretaker complexity
The caretaker must manage memento creation, storage, and retrieval carefully, especially when there are many states.
Needs careful management of old mementos
Without proper pruning, the buildup of old mementos can lead to performance or memory issues.


===========================================================================================================

Real Life Use Cases
The Memento Pattern is highly useful in systems where object states need to be saved and restored over time without exposing their internal structure. Here are two real-world examples of where this pattern can be applied effectively:

1. Text Editors (e.g., Notepad, Google Docs):
In text editors, users often rely on undo and redo functionalities to reverse or repeat changes. Every time the user makes an edit, the current state of the document can be stored as a memento. When the user presses undo, the editor restores the previous state from the most recent memento. This allows users to seamlessly navigate back and forth through changes without accessing or modifying the internal details of the document object.

2. Graphic Design or Drawing Applications:
Applications like Photoshop or Figma allow users to apply changes step by step (e.g., drawing, coloring, transforming objects). With each significant operation, a snapshot (memento) of the canvas or component’s state is saved. Users can then use undo to revert to a specific state. This keeps the design process non-destructive and flexible while ensuring encapsulation of the canvas data.

These examples demonstrate how the Memento Pattern enables powerful undo/redo support and history management, all while preserving encapsulation and reducing system complexity.

        // Step 2: Modify the resume

    }
}

Issues in the Above Code
No Caretaker Role
The snapshot is being manually handled inside the main() method. There's no dedicated class to manage multiple states.
No Undo/Redo Stack
Only a single snapshot is supported. You can't perform multiple levels of undo or redo.
Breaks Encapsulation
The fields in ResumeSnapshot are public. This exposes internal details and violates encapsulation.
Tightly Coupled Implementation
ResumeSnapshot directly accesses and depends on the internal structure of ResumeEditor. If the fields change, the snapshot class must change too.
No Abstraction
There's no abstraction to hide how snapshots are created or restored. Everything is directly visible and modifiable.
