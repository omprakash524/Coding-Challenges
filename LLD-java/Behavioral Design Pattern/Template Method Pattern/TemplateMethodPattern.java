// Template Method Pattern
/*
 * In Template Method Pattern, an abstract class defines the template (skeleton) of an algorithm in a method,
 * deferring some steps to subclasses. This allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of the algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
 * This pattern is useful when you have an algorithm that consists of several steps, and you want to allow subclasses to provide specific implementations for some of those steps.

 * Introduction
Behavioral design patterns focus on how objects communicate and collaborate with each other to define the flow of control in a system. These patterns aim to simplify complex logic and improve the structure of interactions while promoting loose coupling between objects.

Imagine you are baking a cake using a predefined recipe. The recipe lays out the general steps you need to follow, like mixing ingredients, preheating the oven, and baking the cake. While the basic steps are fixed, the specific details (such as the ingredients or the flavor) can be varied. The Template Pattern helps to manage this by defining the basic structure of an algorithm while allowing certain steps to be implemented by subclasses.

Let’s explore the Template Pattern in more detail in the upcoming sections.

Template Pattern

Formal Definition
The Template Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a blueprint for executing an algorithm. It allows subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm, but the overall structure remains the same. This ensures that the invariant parts of the algorithm are not changed, while enabling customization in the variable parts.
Real Life Analogy
Imagine you are following a recipe to bake a cake. The overall process of baking a cake (preheat oven, mix ingredients, bake, and cool) is fixed, but the specific ingredients or flavors may vary (chocolate, vanilla, etc.).

The Template Pattern is like the recipe: it defines the basic structure of the process (steps), while allowing the specific ingredients (or steps) to be varied depending on the cake type.
Key Steps in Template Pattern
The Template Pattern generally consists of four key steps:
Template Method (Final Method in Base Class)
This method defines the skeleton of the algorithm. It calls the various steps and determines their sequence. This method is final to prevent overriding in subclasses, ensuring that the algorithm’s structure stays consistent.
Primitive Operations (Abstract Methods)
These are abstract methods that subclasses must implement. These methods represent the variable parts of the algorithm that may change based on the subclass’s specific requirements.
Concrete Operations (Final or Concrete Methods)
These are methods that contain behavior common to all subclasses. They are defined in the base class and are shared by all subclasses.
Hooks (Optional Methods with Default Behavior)
Hooks are optional methods in the base class that provide default behavior. Subclasses can override these methods to modify the behavior when needed, but they are not mandatory for all subclasses to implement.

By using the Template Pattern, one can ensure that the common steps of an algorithm remain unchanged while allowing subclasses to modify the specific details of the algorithm.

=============================================================================
Key Steps of Template Pattern Used 
Template Method (Final Method in Base Class)
The send() method is the template method that defines the skeleton of the algorithm. It calls common steps such as rateLimitCheck, validateRecipient, preSendAuditLog, etc., and delegates customizable actions like composeMessage and sendMessage to subclasses.
Primitive Operations (Abstract Methods)
The methods composeMessage() and sendMessage() are abstract, meaning they must be implemented by subclasses (EmailNotification and SMSNotification) to define specific behaviors for each notification type.
Concrete Operations (Final or Concrete Methods)
Methods like rateLimitCheck, validateRecipient, preSendAuditLog, and postSendAnalytics are defined in the base class as concrete operations because they contain common logic shared by both email and SMS notifications.
Hooks (Optional Methods with Default Behavior)
The postSendAnalytics method is an optional hook that can be overridden by subclasses (e.g., SMSNotification overrides this method to provide custom analytics behavior). Subclasses can choose to use or skip this method based on specific requirements.

How This Approach Solves the Issues
Issue	Solution with Template Pattern
Code Duplication	The common steps (rate limit checks, recipient validation, logging, etc.) are now centralized in the base class, reducing duplication.
Hardcoded Behavior	The specific behaviors (email vs SMS) are handled by subclasses, making the code more flexible and extensible.
Lack of Extensibility	New types of notifications (e.g., PushNotification) can be added by subclassing NotificationSender and implementing the abstract methods.
Maintenance Overhead	Common logic is handled in one place (the base class), so updating behaviors (like rate limit checks or logging) only requires changes in the base class.
When to Use the Template Pattern
The Template Pattern is best suited in the following scenarios:

When multiple classes follow the same algorithm but differ in a few steps.When multiple classes follow the same algorithm but differ in a few steps. This pattern allows the core structure to remain the same while enabling flexibility in specific steps of the algorithm.
When you want to avoid code duplication of common steps. The Template Pattern centralizes shared logic in the base class, promoting code reusability.
When you need to enforce a fixed order of steps. This pattern ensures that the steps of an algorithm follow a specific sequence, which can be crucial in certain operations.
When you want to provide optional customizations. Subclasses can override specific steps to customize the behavior while still maintaining the overall algorithm.
When you need a structured flow. The Template Pattern ensures that subclasses follow a certain framework, with the flexibility to implement specific details.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Template Method

Pros
Promotes code reusability by sharing the same steps
The Template Pattern helps in sharing common steps across different classes, ensuring that they follow the same algorithm without duplicating code.
Supports OCP (Open/Closed Principle)
New behaviors (custom steps) can be added by extending the base class without modifying its existing code, supporting the Open/Closed Principle.
Enforces a consistent flow
The pattern ensures a fixed sequence of steps, making the flow predictable and consistent across all subclasses.
Allows optional customization via hook methods
The use of hooks allows subclasses to modify or extend behavior when needed without changing the base structure.

Cons
Inheritance-based, limits flexibility
The Template Pattern uses inheritance, which can reduce flexibility as the behavior is tightly coupled with the base class.
Subclasses are tightly coupled with the base class
Any changes in the base class may affect all subclasses, making it harder to modify or extend certain features independently.
Not ideal if the algorithm varies, switch to Strategy Pattern
If the algorithm changes significantly, the Template Pattern becomes less suitable, and using the Strategy Pattern may be a better choice.
May result in too many subclasses
If the number of steps to be customized grows, you might end up creating too many subclasses, making the codebase harder to maintain.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Real World Products where Template Pattern is Used
The Template Pattern is commonly used in real-world applications where the overall structure of an operation is fixed, but specific steps need to be customizable. Here are some examples:

1. TUF+ Payment Flow
In TUF+, the payment flow for both Indian and International transactions follows a predefined sequence. This sequence includes steps like validating the payment method, processing the payment, and updating the account. While these steps remain the same, the specifics (such as validating a UPI ID for Indian payments or a credit card for international payments) can vary between subclasses, providing flexibility and customization.
2. Game Engines
Game engines like Unity or Unreal Engine use the Template Pattern in their game loop and rendering process. The framework for rendering a frame is common (input handling, physics update, rendering), but specific actions (e.g., rendering techniques or AI decision-making) can be customized in different games through subclassing.
3. Frameworks
Many web frameworks, like Spring or Django, use the Template Pattern for handling requests. These frameworks define the common flow for handling HTTP requests (e.g., URL mapping, request handling, response formatting), but allow developers to override certain steps like request validation, database queries, or rendering logic.

// without Template Method Pattern
Issues In This Code
Code Duplication:
Both EmailNotification and SMSNotification contain nearly identical logic for rate limit checking, message formatting, logging, and analytics. This violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, making the code harder to maintain.
Hardcoded Behavior:
The behavior for sending emails and SMS is tightly coupled with the send() method. If we need to add a new notification type (e.g., Push Notification), we would need to duplicate the entire logic and modify each notification class.
Lack of Extensibility:
If we need to change the logic for rate limit checks, logging, or analytics, we will have to modify it across all notification classes, leading to potential errors and inconsistencies.
Maintenance Overhead: With each new notification type, you are adding more classes with similar code, making the system increasingly difficult to manage as it grows.

class EmailNotification{
    public void sendEmail(String to, String rawMessage){
        // Step 1: Rate limit check
        System.out.println("Rate limit check for " + to);
        
        // Step 2: Validate recipient
        System.out.println("Validating recipient: " + to);
        
        // Step 3: Format message
        String formatted = rawMessage.trim();
        System.out.println("Formatting message");
        
        // Step 4: Pre-send audit log

        // Step 6: Send message
        System.out.println("Sending email to " + to + " with message: " + composedMessage);
        
        // Step 7: Post-send analytics
        System.out.println("Post-send analytics for " + to);
    }
}

class SMSNotification{
    public void sendSMS(String to, String rawMessage){
        // Step 1: Rate limit check
        System.out.println("Rate limit check for " + to);
        
        // Step 2: Validate recipient
        System.out.println("Validating recipient: " + to);

        // Step 6: Send message
        System.out.println("Sending SMS to " + to + " with message: " + composedMessage);
        
        // Step 7: Post-send analytics
        System.out.println("Post-send analytics for " + to);
    }
}
