🔹 What are Structural Design Patterns?

Structural Design Patterns deal with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.
They focus on the relationships between entities, making it easier to design flexible and efficient code.

Think of them as blueprints for arranging code structures so that parts of a system fit together well.

🔹 Key Idea

Instead of focusing on object creation (Creational patterns) or behavior (Behavioral patterns),
Structural patterns are about "How to assemble objects & classes".

They help reduce complexity by using composition and inheritance smartly.

🔹 Common Structural Design Patterns

1. Adapter Pattern

Converts one interface into another the client expects.

Example: Charger adapter that allows a U.S. plug to fit into an Indian socket.

2. Bridge Pattern

Decouples abstraction from implementation so they can vary independently.

Example: A Remote (abstraction) can work with different types of TV (implementation).

3. Composite Pattern

Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.

Example: A folder containing files and subfolders (both treated uniformly).

4. Decorator Pattern

Dynamically adds responsibilities to an object without altering its structure.

Example: Adding extra toppings to a pizza object (Cheese, Olives, etc.).

5. Facade Pattern

Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

Example: A “Home Theater” remote that starts TV, speakers, and DVD with one click.

6. Flyweight Pattern

Reduces memory usage by sharing common data between similar objects.

Example: Characters in a text editor share the same font style object.

7. Proxy Pattern

Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access.

Example: Virtual proxy that loads a large image only when needed.

🔹 Why Use Structural Design Patterns?

✅ Simplify complex relationships
✅ Increase flexibility and reusability
✅ Make large systems easier to maintain
✅ Optimize performance (e.g., Flyweight)
