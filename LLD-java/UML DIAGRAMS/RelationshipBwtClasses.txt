Relationship Between Classes

1. Association (USE-A)
Association represents a general relationship between two classes where one class uses or interacts with another. It can be: one-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-many.
Example: A teacher can teach multiple students, and a student can be taught by multiple teachers (many-to-many association).
UML Notation: A solid line between the two classes.
2. Aggregation (HAS-A)
Aggregation is a "whole-part" relationship where a class is made up of one or more classes, but those parts can exist independently.
Example: A Department has multiple Professors. If the department is removed, the professors still exist.
UML Notation: A hollow diamond at the container (whole) class.
3. Composition (Strong HAS-A)
Composition is a stronger form of aggregation where the part cannot exist without the whole. It is a "whole-part" relationship where the part is dependent on the whole.
Example: A House has Rooms. If the House is destroyed, so are the Rooms.
UML Notation: A filled diamond at the whole side.
4. Inheritance
Inheritance defines an IS-A relationship where a subclass inherits properties and behavior from a superclass. The subclass can extend or override the superclass's attributes and methods.
Example: A Dog is an Animal.
UML Notation: A solid line with a filled triangle pointing to the parent class.
5. Realization (Implementation)
Realization is the relationship between a class and an interface. The class agrees to implement the behavior declared by the interface.
Example: A Circle class implements the Shape interface.
UML Notation: A dashed line with a filled triangle pointing to the interface.
6. Dependency
Dependency indicates that a class uses another class temporarily. Changes to the used class may affect the dependent class.
Example: OrderService depends on PaymentService to process payments.
UML Notation: A dashed line with an open arrow pointing to the class being used.


Example – E-commerce System

Let’s design a mini class diagram for an E-commerce app:

                   --------------------
                   |   User            |
                   --------------------
                   | - userId: int     |
                   | - name: String    |
                   | - email: String   |
                   --------------------
                   | + login()         |
                   | + logout()        |
                   --------------------
                          1
                          |
                          | 0..*
                          v
                   --------------------
                   |   Order           |
                   --------------------
                   | - orderId: int    |
                   | - date: Date      |
                   | - status: String  |
                   --------------------
                   | + placeOrder()    |
                   | + cancelOrder()   |
                   --------------------
                          1
                          |
                          | 1..*
                          v
                   --------------------
                   |   OrderItem       |
                   --------------------
                   | - quantity: int   |
                   | - price: double   |
                   --------------------
                          ^
                          | 1..*
                          |
                   --------------------
                   |   Product         |
                   --------------------
                   | - productId: int  |
                   | - name: String    |
                   | - price: double   |
                   --------------------
